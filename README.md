# DataIncubator
Part of the Data Incubator Challenge


For my project I will look at banks and how to choose among them, providing a tool (web based) to locate be best bank.   Banks in many aspects are the holders of our trust, we store with them our hard earn money, with the ideal that it will be kept safe.  Throughout resent years it has been clear, either by scandals or financial crises that not all banks are equal. That some banks are more resilient than other, but there is no a simple way to lookup which bank is safer.  This project will analyze bank data to determine what is the best sound bank around a personâ€™s zip code/adress and give tools to help any individual understand their bank financial situation. 

To analyze the resilience of a bank I will use two simplify metrics at first: Solvency and Liquidity.  Solvency is important since informs how many (percentile wise) of the assets can go under before the bank goes bankrupt. Liquidity informs how much cash at hand they have before they run out of it.  This both metrics will give a general picture of the banks financial state. 

The bank data will be obtain from the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council's (FFIEC) among other sources.  For the zip code/adres search the project will use google's engine search.
